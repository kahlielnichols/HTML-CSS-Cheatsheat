        <h1>Git Cheat Sheet</h1>

        <h3>What is Git?</h3>

        <p>
        Git is the most widely used modern version control system in the world today.  
        </p>

        <h3>Performances</h3>
        <p>
          Git take advantage of deep knowledge about common attributes of real source code file trees, how they are usually modified over time and what the access patterns are.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Being distributed enables significant performance benefits as well.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Security
        </h3>
      
        <p>
          Git has been designed with the integrity of managed source code as a top priority.
        </p>
        <P>
          Some other version control systems have no protections against secret alteration at a later date
        </P>
        <h3>
          Flexibility
        </h3>
        <p>
          One of Git's key design objectives is flexibility. Git is flexible in several respects:
        </p>
        <P>
          In support for various kinds of nonlinear development workflows, in its efficiency in both small and large projects and in its compatibility with many existing systems and protocols.
        </P>
        <h3>
          Version control with Git
        </h3>
        <P>
          Git is the best choice for most software teams today. 
        </P>
        <h3>
          Git is good
        </h3>
        <p>
          Git has the functionality, performance, security and flexibility that most teams and individual developers need. 
        </p>

            <li>You can see your stashed changes with git stash list, which might return an output that looks like this:</li>
            <li>You can use git archive to compress your versioned code</li>
            <li>The .git folder</li>
            <li>git log --pretty</li>
            <li>git commit --amend</li>
            <li>Use git revert to undo shared history</li>
            <li>Find broken commits with git bisect</li>
            <li>Undo committed changes to a single file</li>
            <li>Use the -- operator to disambiguate command arguments from refs</li>
            <li>Use git reflog to recover deleted branches</li>
