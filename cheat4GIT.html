        <h3>What is Git?</h3>

        <p>
        Git is the most widely used modern version control system in the world today.  
        </p>

        <h3>Performances</h3>
        <p>
          Git take advantage of deep knowledge about common attributes of real source code file trees, how they are usually modified over time and what the access patterns are.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Being distributed enables significant performance benefits as well.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Security
        </h3>
      
        <p>
          Git has been designed with the integrity of managed source code as a top priority.
        </p>
        <P>
          Some other version control systems have no protections against secret alteration at a later date
        </P>
        <h3>
          Flexibility
        </h3>
        <p>
          One of Git's key design objectives is flexibility. Git is flexible in several respects:
        </p>
        <P>
          In support for various kinds of nonlinear development workflows, in its efficiency in both small and large projects and in its compatibility with many existing systems and protocols.
        </P>
        <h3>
          Version control with Git
        </h3>
        <P>
          Git is the best choice for most software teams today. 
        </P>
        <h3>
          Git is good
        </h3>
        <p>
          Git has the functionality, performance, security and flexibility that most teams and individual developers need. 
        </p>

        <h2>Repository</h2>
            <p>The overall package or project. There is typically a remote of origin respository, and a local copy of it at certain time on your local machine</p>
        
            <h2>Branch</h2>
            <p>An extension of a repository. All repositories, or repos,start with a 'master' branch. From there, new branches can be created and used for new features. The idea is to keep the master branch clean and working for the final " done" project.</p>
        
            <h2>Commit</h2>
            <p>a commit is a change to the repository. For every commit made, there is a recod of the state of the repository at that given point in time.</p>
       
            <h2>cd (change directory)</h2>
            <p>--changes the directory or folder</p>
       
            <h2>cd </h2>
            <p>-- will take you to the home directory</p>
        
            <h2>cd ..</h2>
            <p>--moves up one directory</p>
        
            <h2>ls</h2>
            <p>--lists the files or directories</p>
       
            <h2>git init</h2>
            <p>--creates a new local respository in the current directory</p>
       
            <h2>git cheakout -b {branch name}</h2>
            <p>--shorthand comman to create and switch to a new branch</p>
        
            <h2>git branch {branch name}</h2>
            <p>--creates a new branch</p>
        
            <h2>git cheakout {branch name}</h2>
            <p>--switches to the branch</p>
       
            <h2>git branch -a</h2>
            <p>--displays all branches, both local and remote, that are available</p>
        
            <h2>git status -- RUN A LOT</h2>
            <p>Tells what files have been added, deleted, and modified</p>
            <p>Informs if the local branch is behind the remote version or if the version is ahead of the remote repository</p>
        
            <h2> git add {file, directory, or, other}</h2>
             <p>-- stages the changes to be committed</p>
       
             <h2>git branch . --</h2>
             <p>--stages all changes from the directory</p>
       
             <h2>git commit -m"" (commit message)</h2>
            <p>--This commits the added changes locally and attaches the commit message to the commit</p>
            <p>commit messages chould be short but decriptive of all the changes made</p>
            <p>committing dose not push changes to the remote repository</p>
        <h2>git push</h2>
            <p>--takes the locally committed changes for a given branch and applies them to the local version</p>
        
              <h2>git push -u origin {branch name}</h2>
            <p>-- This command is used for pushing to the remote repository with the specific branch name</p>
        <h2>git pull</h2>
            <p>-- takes the changes made to the remote repository and applies them to the local version</p>
        <li> mkdir < folder name ></li>
            <li>rmdir < folder name ></li>
